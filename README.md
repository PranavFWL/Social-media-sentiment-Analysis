## Social media sentiment analysis

This project analyzes sentiment in social media data to determine whether posts express positive, negative, or neutral emotions. It gives insights into public opinion by processing social media text and visualizing key sentiment trends.

## Project overview

This repository contains the code and tools to take social media text data—such as tweets or Facebook posts—and run sentiment analysis on them. It includes scripts or notebooks to clean the data, extract features, build and evaluate a classifier, and produce visual insights like sentiment over time or most frequent terms by sentiment category.

## What’s inside


• Data folder – raw and cleaned social media text (for example, CSV or JSON files)
• Notebooks – Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and visualization
• Scripts – Python scripts to run sentiment analysis or create charts (if any)
• Saved models – trained classification models and serialization files (for example, pickle files)
• Requirements file – to install necessary Python libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, nltk, or TextBlob

Features

• Preprocess social media text: lowercasing, stop word removal, tokenization, maybe emoji handling
• Feature extraction using TF–IDF or word embeddings
• Train classifiers such as logistic regression, naive Bayes, or simple neural networks
• Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score
• Visualize sentiment distribution (for example, pie charts or bar plots), trends over time, or word clouds of most positive and negative words

# Setting up the project

1. Download or clone the repository
2. Install the required Python packages using:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Place your social media dataset in the data folder (ensure it has fields like text and optional timestamp)

Usage guide

To explore or train the model:

– Open the main notebook (for example `SentimentAnalysis.ipynb`) and run through the cells: preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation
– If there are standalone scripts (for example `run_sentiment.py`), run them from the command line and pass the dataset path to output results or visualizations

To see results:

– View charts like sentiment over time or word clouds for each sentiment
– Check performance metrics printed in the notebook or script output

Future enhancements

• Incorporate more advanced NLP techniques such as transformers or pretrained language models like BERT
• Add support for multimodal sentiment analysis using images or audio from social media posts
• Deploy sentiment analysis via a web app or dashboard using frameworks like Streamlit
• Expand to aspect-based sentiment analysis to detect opinions about specific topics within posts
• Improve preprocessing to handle social media quirks like slang, misspellings, repeated letters, and emojis ([WIRED][1])
